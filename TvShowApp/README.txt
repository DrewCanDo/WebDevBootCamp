This Read Me txt file is to explain the TvShowApp

This mini tut has axios loading in from the html file.
axios is a popular JS library used to make HTTP requests 
from both web browsers and Node.js environments. it makes the process
easier to talk with web servers and APIs. it is a promise based HTTP
client that offers features like interceptors, automatic JSON transformation, 
and requests cancellation, making it a versatile tool for web dev.

this will start from the JS side.

there are HTML elements like forms and buttons in the project.

the input element has the name query.

we find the form element and listen for a click event.

we run a async function that grabs the value out of the input and 
sends it to an api search.

it then returns the value and we send it to a created IMG element.

Next we append the element to the body of the document and this will 
show the image to the user.

Lastly we clear the search box input. so that the user can add a much 
as they want.

END.
